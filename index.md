I'm a second year Doctoral student at IIT Madras, jointly advised by Prof. [V. Kamakoti](https://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/profile.php?arg=MTg=) and Prof. [Pratyush Kumar](http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~pratyush/) at IIT Madras and Prof. [Anand Raghunathan](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~araghu/) from Purdue University. 

My research interests broadly include specialized computer architectures. My current focus is on developing energy efficient hardware accelerators for Deep Learning Applications. I am particularly looking to develop Hardware Architectures which exploit the underlying sparsity in DNNs.


I am also primarily involved in the [SHAKTI processor program](https://iitmshakti.bitbucket.io/), where I developed the Floating Point Unit and the peripherals for a Micro-Controller class Processor (**C-Class Processors**), which is **taped-out** in **Intel's 22nm FFL process**. I am also driving the Vector Processor development effort in the SHAKTI group. 

The SHAKTI C-Class codebase can be found [here](https://bitbucket.org/casl/c-class).
 
The Vector-Processor (in its initial phase) codebase can be found [here](https://bitbucket.org/casl/shakti_public/src/a07bfad52040965d667df5613b2a280b482d38e0/cores/common_modules/VectorAccel/?at=master).
