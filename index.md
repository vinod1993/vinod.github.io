I'm a PhD student at IIT Madras advised by [Pratyush Kumar](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/pratykumar/) and Prof.[V. Kamakoti](https://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/profile.php?arg=MTg=). Previously, I was an Oveseas Doctoral Scholar at Purdue University advised by Prof. [Anand Raghunathan](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~araghu/). 

I work on improving the resource efficiency of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and Deep Learning (DL) systems. This is achieved across three principal axes: Building efficient systems, efficient design methodolgies, and efficient networks.   

I am also passionate about micro-architectural security - specifically on side-channel attacks and defenses. I have actively worked on building secure micro-architectures that detect and thwart timing and power side-channel attacks. I am fortunate to have Prof. [Chester](https://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~chester/) and [Biswa](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/biswap/) as academic collaborators in these topics of interest.
  
I was an integral part of the [SHAKTI processor program](http://shakti.org.in), involved in all facets of the chip-design stack from RTL design to post silicon validation of India's very first indigenous microprocessor family: C-Class. The design was [taped-out](http://shakti.org.in/tapeout.html) on Intel's 22nm FFL process and SCL's 180nm process and boots linux successfully. I was also leading the AI/ML accelerator development within the SHAKTI group.
